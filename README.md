# Github_CreditCardValidator

Hi, my name is Achintya Ranjan. This is my very first C++ project. 
So, it is a Credit Card Validator which uses the Luhn's algorithm to verify if the entered credit card number is correct or not.

The steps to verify a credit card number is :
1. We take every second digit from the right of the credit card number and double it. If doubling it makes it a double digit , we add the digits to revert it back to a single digit form and we add all the resulting second digit numbers into a final sum.
2. In the next step, we add the remaining digits to the final sum.
3. Then we check if the final sum is a multiple of 10 or not. If it is, then the credit card number is valid and if it is not, the credit card numbe ris invalid.

Hope you like this project.
